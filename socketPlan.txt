New User Joins a Room
1. When a user joins a room, emit their socket id to all other users in the room.
2. When other users receive that socket id, they should create a peer with that new user.
  - Initiate the handshake by using createPeer function
3. When new user receives the request from the existing users, use addPeer function.

User Leaves a Room
1. Emit their socketid to all other users.
2. Upon receiving the id of someone leaving the room, remove that id from the peers state.
  - Create removePeer function?

Note: peersRef is probably not necessary. Refactor to only reference peers state.
